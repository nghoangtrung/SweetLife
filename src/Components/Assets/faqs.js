    question: "Are there healthy minerals in ice cream?",
    answer:
      "Most ice creams are a rich source of phosphorus and calcium, sometimes even accounting for between 6 to 10% of the Daily Value (DV), that’s for a 1/2 cup serving. Both minerals are important for muscle function and skeletal health.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can ice cream be part of a healthy diet?",
    answer:
      "Everything in moderation! And of course enjoying an ice cream on a hot summer day, with family and friends or after a hard-earned task as a reward—there’s nothing quite like it. To avoid over-indulging, try sticking to minis, smaller bars or cones to keep your portions in check. Or use our advice on a smaller bowl or mug.",

  {
    question: "Are there options for people with nut allergies?",
